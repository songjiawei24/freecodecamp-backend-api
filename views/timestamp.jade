        | I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether 
        | that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language 
        | date (example: January 1, 2016)
      li
        | If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the 
        | natural language form of that date.
      li
        | If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp,  
        | it returns null for those properties.
